# Filter the Words

### Filter the words in 'words.txt' to only include words that have characters a-z and no proper nouns. The filtered words should also be 2 or more characters in length.

### You can do this by using the regular expression below

```Java
line.matches("^[a-z]+$")
```

Output the filtered words to another file called 'filtered.txt'
